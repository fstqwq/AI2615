# AI2615 Programming Guide

This is the programming guide (in Chinese) for AI2615, Algorithm Design and Analysis at SJTU.

It's for 

- helping students to finish programming homework, especially, for those who are not familiar with algorithmic problems.

- maybe some from-zero-to-one tutorial in the future?

Currently deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://ai2615.fstqwq.pw). See the website for more.
